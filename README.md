# Memory Management System Documentation

## Overview

This memory management system provides two storage mechanisms: file-based storage (`PyCells.py`) and SQLite-based storage (`Pycells2.py`). The `membrane.py` script acts as an abstraction layer that integrates both storage methods. The GUI debugger (`membranedebugger.py`) allows users to interact with the system in a user-friendly way. This document provides an in-depth explanation of the system, code examples to showcase its functionality, and a diagram that illustrates how the scripts interact.

---

## System Components

### 1. `PyCells.py` (File-Based Memory System)

This script manages memories by writing them to text files based on memory type. Each type of memory (e.g., general, animals) has its own file, and information is appended to these files as needed.

**Code Example:**

```python
from PyCells import store_memory, retrieve_memory

# Store memory in file-based system
store_memory("Cats are playful creatures", "animals")

# Retrieve memory from file-based system
animal_memories = retrieve_memory("animals")
print(animal_memories)
```

In the example above, a memory about cats is stored in the `animals` memory type. Later, all memories stored under "animals" are retrieved.

### 2. `Pycells2.py` (SQLite Database-Based Memory System)

This script provides a more structured approach, storing memories in an SQLite database. Memories are categorized by tags, which can be queried for retrieval.

**Code Example:**

```python
from Pycells2 import store_memory, retrieve_memory_by_tag, get_memory_tags

# Store memory in the SQLite system
store_memory("Cats love to climb trees")

# Retrieve memory by tag (e.g., 'cats')
cat_memories = retrieve_memory_by_tag('cats')
print(cat_memories)

# List all tags
tags = get_memory_tags()
print(tags)
```

Here, a memory is stored in the SQLite database and associated with the tag `cats`. The example demonstrates how to query memories by tag and retrieve all existing tags.

### 3. `membrane.py` (Memory Abstraction Layer)

The `membrane.py` script acts as an interface for both the file-based (`PyCells.py`) and database-based (`Pycells2.py`) memory systems. It provides methods to store, retrieve, and manipulate memory across both systems.

**Code Example:**

```python
from membrane import store_information, retrieve_by_memory_type, retrieve_by_tag

# Store information in both systems
store_information("Dogs are loyal animals", "animals")

# Retrieve from file-based system (by memory type)
animal_memories = retrieve_by_memory_type("animals")
print(animal_memories)

# Retrieve from SQLite-based system (by tag)
dog_memories = retrieve_by_tag("dogs")
print(dog_memories)
```

This example shows how the `membrane.py` script can store and retrieve information from both the file-based and database-based systems.

### 4. `membranedebugger.py` (GUI Debugger for Memory System)

The `membranedebugger.py` script provides a graphical user interface for interacting with the memory system. It allows users to store, retrieve, search, and edit memories, as well as perform batch uploads of data.

**Key GUI Features:**
- Store memories in both systems.
- Retrieve memories from both systems.
- Search for memories based on keywords or phrases.
- Edit existing memories.
- Perform batch uploads from text files.

**Code Example:**

```python
import tkinter as tk
from membranedebugger import MemoryDebugger

# Start the Memory Debugger GUI
if __name__ == "__main__":
    root = tk.Tk()
    debugger = MemoryDebugger(root)
    root.mainloop()
```

This code initializes and launches the Memory Debugger GUI, providing users with a visual interface for interacting with the memory system.

## Code Interaction Flow

Here is an example of the interaction between the different scripts:

1. **Storing Memory:** When a user stores a memory through `membrane.py`, the script stores the memory in both `PyCells.py` (file-based) and `Pycells2.py` (database-based) systems.
2. **Retrieving Memory:** If the user retrieves memory by memory type, it pulls from the file-based system. If the retrieval is by tag, it pulls from the database system.
3. **Debugging:** The `membranedebugger.py` allows users to visually interact with both systems, log actions, and manage memories.

---

## Code Example Walkthrough

### Storing and Retrieving Memory:

```python
from membrane import store_information, retrieve_by_memory_type, retrieve_by_tag

# Store memory
store_information("Elephants are the largest land animals", "general")

# Retrieve memory from the file-based system
general_memories = retrieve_by_memory_type("general")
print("File-based memories:", general_memories)

# Retrieve memory from the database system by tag
elephant_memories = retrieve_by_tag("elephants")
print("Database-based memories:", elephant_memories)
```

**Explanation:**
- `store_information` stores the sentence "Elephants are the largest land animals" in both systems (file-based and database-based).
- `retrieve_by_memory_type` fetches all memories under the `general` type from the file-based system.
- `retrieve_by_tag` fetches memories associated with the tag `elephants` from the SQLite system.

### Using the Debugger:

The GUI Debugger allows users to perform the same tasks as above, but through a graphical interface. The debugger supports:
- Viewing stored memories.
- Searching for specific memories.
- Editing memory entries.
- Uploading multiple files in bulk for memory storage.

Explanation of Interaction Diagram
User Input: The user performs actions such as storing, retrieving, or editing memories. This is the starting point for interaction with the memory management system.

GUI Debugger (membranedebugger.py): The user's input is processed through a graphical interface, allowing for easy interaction. The GUI serves as the bridge between the user and the memory systems.

Memory Abstraction Layer (membrane.py): This script routes the user’s actions to the appropriate memory storage system. Whether the request is for file-based or database-based storage, this layer determines the correct backend to interact with.

File-Based Memory System (PyCells.py): When a memory is stored or retrieved from text files, it goes through this system. The data is physically stored in the file system as text files.

Database-Based Memory System (Pycells2.py): If the memory is associated with a tag and stored in a database, this system is used. The data is stored in an SQLite database, allowing for structured storage and retrieval.

File System: This is the underlying storage mechanism for the file-based memory system. Memories are saved as text files on the disk.

SQLite Database: This is the storage mechanism for the database-based system, where memories are stored in a structured database format.
